<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 22px; color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>15 Ways to Make Money as a Content Writer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Here&rsquo;s the thing, writing isn&rsquo;t easy for most people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">So if you possess this skill and can help people get their message in front of their audience, regardless of the niche, you can succeed as a freelance writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Here are 15 ways I&rsquo;ve made money as a freelance writer without writing on my own blog.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Website Pages:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Let&rsquo;s rewind to January 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">My blog was failing, I already had my millennial life crisis, and quit my six-figure job the previous year.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">For eight months, I hustled as a blogger and had almost nothing to show for it.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;But as the calendar turned to 2018, I was desperate to make online writing work.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;It was either that or return to corporate (which was my nightmare).</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I decided to pivot from publishing on my own blog to writing for others.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;Upwork and job boards were my best friend and I relentlessly applied for any gig I could.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">This led to one of my first golf writing clients. They were doing a major revamp to the website and needed the following pages rewritten:</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Home page</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>About page</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Membership page</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Work with me page</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>History of the golf course page</strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">At the time, I was just getting started as a writer and couldn&rsquo;t believe someone paid me $1,600 to rewrite five pages of a golf website!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I&rsquo;ve done this with several clients and it&rsquo;s pretty simple and straight forward.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Blog Posts:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I would say that 60% of my $100,000+ freelance writing income has been from writing blog posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Since I was a blogger from 2016 to 2018, these weren&rsquo;t that hard for me to learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;Some were ghostwritten, and others had my name attached to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Let&rsquo;s get real, most blog posts aren&rsquo;t sexy or glamorous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">But they are the most consistent way to make money as a freelance content writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I&rsquo;ve been paid to write about nearly everything including:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Golf</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pets</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Millennials</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Motivation</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Personal finance</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Entrepreneurship</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Self-improvement</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">If you want consistent money each month as a writer, start by finding blog writing clients.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">These clients are dependable and make it easy to forecast your monthly income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">In the beginning, I suggest pricing your work on a per word basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a brand new writer, start at .10 cents per word and work your way up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Finally, make sure you establish a niche so you can become an expert and raise your rates!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Books:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The week I quit my 9&ndash;5, I published my first book, &ldquo;Advice to My Younger Self.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">At the time, I was 29 years old and had aspirations of being the next millennial finance guru. I wanted to help everyone learn what college didn&rsquo;t teach them.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I thought this book was going to land me on podcasts, talk shows, and provide passive income for years.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Well, that dream was short-lived.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The book made maybe $700 (including the extra copies my parents bought to hand out and brag that their son was a writer).</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Needless to say, I quickly realized that my first book wasn&rsquo;t going to make me a millionaire or help a million people.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">But still, I got to say I was a published author at 29 years old and crossed something off my bucket list.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Guestwriting:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">While my first book didn&rsquo;t make me rich, it gave me some experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">After one of my writing clients enjoyed working together, he asked me to ghostwrite his book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">While it&rsquo;s yet to get published, I got paid for it and it led to my highest income month ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">The book ended up being 65,000 words and I got paid $13,000. Just a little more than my $700 for my first book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">So if you want to write a book and money is your main goal, I suggest ghostwriting for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">&nbsp;Unless you have a massive social media following, good luck self-publishing.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">eBooks:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">At the end of 2018, I landed my first writing client through Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">He saw my motivational content, clicked the link in my bio, went to my writing website, and reached out via DM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">The first project we worked on was an eBook lead magnet. I ended up creating several for him and they ranged between 5,000 to 10,000 words.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">My eBook:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I also tried my hand at self-publishing and bought a course to guide me through it.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Even though my first book didn&rsquo;t make me rich or famous, I liked the idea of creating passive income.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Needless to say, this idea failed. I bet I made $100 total, not enough to pay for the course. Plus, it took way too much time.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">So if your goal is to self-publish eBooks via the Kindle store, make sure you outsource as much as possible, learn about Amazon ads, and find your niche.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><strong>Email Marketing:-</strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Email marketing is not dead (despite what some online gurus say).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Yes, email marketing has been a steady decline over the past five to ten years, but it&rsquo;s still the best way to sell anything to your audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Email writing is a great way to make consistent money as a writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Clients need writers to help tell their story and I&rsquo;ve helped create several email campaigns. Some of them include:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Nurture sequences</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Weekly newsletters</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Online course launch</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I&rsquo;m still a rookie in this category, but I plan to experiment a lot more with copywriting and email marketing in 2020.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Lead Magnets:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Another way to make money writing is by creating lead magnets for clients (AKA freebies, freemiums, list-builders, opt-ins, etc.)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">This is another way I&rsquo;ve been paid as a writer and a method that&rsquo;s been relatively easy as well.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;Since the content isn&rsquo;t getting published online, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about SEO, so it speeds up the entire writing process.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">These projects are usually a fixed fee or per word, as some of them are short eBooks which are really like a long-form blog post.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Rewriting Content:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">As you know, not all content is created equally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">With Google constantly updating their algorithm, it&rsquo;s important to refresh content.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;Some savvy clients will also have you update past posts from yourself or other writers.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">For example, one of my golf clients is refreshing all of his content that isn&rsquo;t ranking on page one.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;To make the necessary updates, he sends me a link of the post within Surfer SEO to make necessary updates.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The SEO tool shows you what you need to do in order to get that article to rank properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Maybe it&rsquo;s removing keywords, adding a certain number of words, removing headings, adding LSI keywords, and more.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">For rewrites, we agree on a flat fee in advance. This is pretty easy as you don&rsquo;t have to come up with new content from scratch.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Online Course Content:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The online learning space is booming!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">According to this survey, &ldquo;the global eLearning market was worth an impressive $107 billion in 2015.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;By 2025, however, Research and Markets believe that it will reach a staggering total market value of $325 billion.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">With so many entrepreneurs, thought leaders, and influencers creating online courses, they need writers to help them turn their knowledge into a course.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I&rsquo;ve written the content for two online courses in the personal development niche for an entrepreneur.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;I was tasked with creating lesson plans (basically blog posts), video scripts, and worksheets.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">One is a six-module course that paid $3,000 and the other was a 12-module massive course that paid $11,000!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Remember, this is a growing market and one I highly encourage you to pursue as a writer.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Podcast:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">As online learning is growing, podcasts aren&rsquo;t far behind.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">According to Podcast Insights, there are over 30 million episodes as of January 2020.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;Yet, according to the same article, only 51% of the population have listened to a podcast, which means there is a huge amount of growth potential.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I&rsquo;ve been hired to create:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>Intro</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Outro</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Show notes</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Podcast scripts</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Social media captions</strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">If you&rsquo;re a new writer, this is a great way to meet podcasters, grow your network, and make money writing.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Social Media Captions:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Nothing fancy here, just writing captions on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn for several clients.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">These are usually a flat-fee for each post or something that is part of a monthly retainer package.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Voice-Overs:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">While I haven&rsquo;t done a ton of voice-overs, I was able to write one that ended up going viral with 2,000,000 views!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">One of my old clients, Fearless Motivation, switched from having me write blog posts to video scripts.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">But after they heard my voice on my show, &ldquo;Inspire Your Success&rdquo; podcast, they had me do voice-over work as well.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;I sent in the audio file (which took about three takes and only 40 minutes) and it was done.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The pay was only a few hundred bucks, but the exposure has been epic.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;They added the amazing visuals to the video and now, two million people have heard it worldwide!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Don&rsquo;t forget, money isn&rsquo;t everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Knowing that my message potentially impacted 2,000,000+ people with my words is priceless.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Video Scripts:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Video is the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">While writing will never go away (don&rsquo;t worry, writers), more and more people are watching video content than ever before.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">After one client heard my work with Fearless Motivation, he hired me to write video scripts and used his voice to create a series of motivational videos.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">This was one of my favorite projects ever.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I got paid .20 cents per word and each post was around 1,000 words. I did 20 video scripts, so I ended up making roughly $4,000.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Not only was this fun and highly profitable, but it&rsquo;s also great to see some of them go viral!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Press Releases:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">When it comes to accepting gigs, I live by this quote:</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&ldquo;If someone offers you an amazing opportunity and you&rsquo;re not sure you can do it, say yes &mdash; then learn how to do it later.&rdquo; &mdash; Richard Branson</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">When a client asked if I could do a press release, I said yes, no problem (despite not having an idea what to do)!</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">While I&rsquo;ve only done a few of them (and had to research what the hell I was doing) overall, they were pretty easy.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">These were based on a per word rate and only contributed a few hundred dollars.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Speech Writing:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">One of the final ways I&rsquo;ve been paid as a content writer is by speech writing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Similar to the press releases, I had no clue what I was doing but I just said yes and figured it out later.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I ended up writing the talking points for a corporate presentation since I knew my client&rsquo;s voice and story so well.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;Someone else did all the PowerPoint, and I did the writing.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Medium:-</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The final way I&rsquo;ve made money writing is by publishing on Medium.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I tried to publish starting in 2017 (just look at my awful articles) but never stayed consistent until now.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Since 2020, I&rsquo;ve started making money via the Medium Partner program, coaching students, and affiliate sales.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Medium is my top writing priority for 2020, so I hope to have more to share on this soon.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">Final Thoughts</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Hopefully, you can tell there are tons of ways to get paid to write content online.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Don&rsquo;t feel like you just have to write emails or blog posts for clients.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
